        <p class="card-text text-left">Executive Summery:

            UX design of a fuel delivery app that provides convenient, on-demand, and safe fuel delivery to individuals and businesses.

            Problem:

            Traditional refueling practices are inconvenient,
            time-consuming, and potentially unsafe.

            Goal:

            To develop a fuel delivery app that provides users with a convenient, on-demand, and safe fuel delivery solution which saves time while offering convenience and safety.

            Scope & Timeline:

            Five phases of the UX design process were utilized over the course of 30 days to yield a high-fidelity prototype.

            Timeline: 30 Days
            Tools: Hand Drawn Prototype, FigJam (Wireframe), Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop

    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item">User Research: Our research plan focused on 20-minute interviews of five prospective fuel delivery app users.
            We utilized Affinity Diagraming and Empathy Mapping to analyze the findings from the interviews and determine our User Persona.
            Ryan and Emily are 35-year-old business professionals who have 10 years of white-collar work experience and are committed to their jobs. Both commute in their personal autos to maintain flexibility and control.
            </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Definition & Synthesis: Research synthesis yields key insights and problems:User Insight
            An app for on-demand fuel delivery addresses issues with traditional refueling by optimizing convenience, saving time, simplifying payment, and ensuring safety.Problem
            Busy professionals like Ryan and Emily need on-demand fuel delivery for convenience, time savings, easy payment, and personal safety during daily commutes.
            </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Ideation: Ideation and Discovery
            We utilized Brainstorming, Feature Prioritization, and Storyboarding to formulate and iterate a User Scenario and Journey Map and yield the following Value Proposition.
            Value Proposition
            FuelFastTM is an on-demand fuel delivery app that delivers fuel to user designated locations with optimized convenience, time savings, ease of payment, and assurance of personal safety.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Prototyping & Visual Design: 
                We completed a thorough competitor analysis to formulate our user flow.
                Once our user flow was formulated, we utilized paper sketches and low-fidelity prototyping to achieve our high-fidelity prototype and visual design.                
                </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Testing Outcomes: 
                    Our test plan focused on 20-minute interviews of five prospective fuel delivery app users.
                    We conducted User Test Analysis to iterate our user flow, feature prioritization, and prototype.
                    Our testing results met the requirements in our problem statement and affirmed that we can achieve our value proposition.                    
                    </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Conclusion: Proactive listening during customer interviews to uncover genuine pain points, needs, and desires is essential to user persona formulation.
User insight and problem statements must be broad enough for wide market appeal but narrow enough to define true differentiators in your value proposition.
Feature prioritization viewed through a realistic user scenario, storyboard, and journey map is vital to inform development of prototypes with true market appeal.

Future Opportunities: Next steps are to expand our universe of prospective users and conduct additional user testing to further inform and iterate our current app prototype.
